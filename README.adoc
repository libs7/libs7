# libs7

A Scheme interpreter derived from link:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html[s7].  For more information see link:https://iainctduncan.github.io/scheme-for-max-docs/s7.html[Why S7 Scheme?].

This library uses a stripped-down and modified copy of the s7 sources;
it includes only what is needed to build OBazl tools like
link:https://github.com/obazl/mibl[mibl],
link:https://github.com/obazl/tools_obazl[tools_obazl],


This is a component of the link:https://obazl.github.io/docs_obazl/[OBazl Toolsuite].

Build targets:

* `bazel build @libs7//src:s7` - produces `libs7.lo`, `libc_s7.so`
* `bazel build @libs7//src:c_s7` - produces `libc_s7.so`
* `bazel run @libs7//src:repl` - launches a primitive repl (currently broken)
