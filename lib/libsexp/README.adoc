= libsexp

Exports one function, `sexp:read`, that reads a file of sexps into a single alist.

Dune files support and include directive, e.g. `(include <path>)`.
libsexp will expand such includes if global flag
`*sexp:expand-includes*` is set to `#t`, which is the default.  To disable:

    (set! '*sexp:expand-includes* #f)

For Dune files (OCaml), corrects the following incompatibilities:

* bad dot - converts '.' to symbol './, e.g  `(run ...  .)` => `(run ... ./)`

* end-of-line string literals, `+"\| ...`. Converts to single string.
