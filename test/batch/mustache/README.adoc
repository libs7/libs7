= libs7 mustache batch tests

Integration tests, to verify that the various parts work together
harmoniously: "reading" data (json, scm, or toml), possibly munging it
using the Scheme APIs (libjson, libtoml), and rendering it by template
with the mustache API.

Each test is expressed as a little Scheme program that reads a data
file and a template file, may do some munging of the data, and then
runs `mustache:render`. The test runner sets the context by defining
some vars base on the build target arguments, then loads the test
program. Then it writes the string returned by the program to the
outfile.



Tests case001 - case006 are taken from the C mustach implementation
from which this derives. But only case002 is currently implemented.
