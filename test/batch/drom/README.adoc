= drom toml

link:https://github.com/OCamlPro/drom[drom] is an OCaml application
that uses a variant of toml as its data format. Unfortunately it is
not actually toml; it supports stuff like repeating `[table]` entries
that are forbidden by toml, and it adds some other stuff.

These tests use the "toml" files from the drom project, converted to proper toml grammar.
