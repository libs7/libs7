WARNING - if linkstatic is False, then the runtime
linker may pick up system shared libs rather than those listed as
deps here. This can be true even for static deps, e.g.
libgbdm_s7, which is statically linked to libgdbm.a - at
runtime the system libgbdm.so may be loaded.

linkstatic=True means (for cc_test): "all user libraries are linked
statically (if a static version is available), but system
libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries) are linked
dynamically,"

linkstatic=False means "all libraries are linked dynamically (if a
dynamic version is available)". Which evidently means you can build
against a static lib dependency, but the runtime linker may find a
shared system lib, effectively overriding the dep you want. (This
has happened with libgdbm, where we built with 1.23, but at runtime
the gdbm_version string reported 1.18.0, which meant it was
(evidently) coming from the locally installed dso
(/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgdbm.so.6)
